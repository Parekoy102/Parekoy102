              <p>I spent a brief moment under the roof of a T’boli musician recognized for his exceptional 
                skill in the two-stringed lute called hegelung, and many other traditional instruments. 
                It was an honor to hear him play and see him perform. His name is Ma Fil Angkoy.  
                The unfortunate news of this great man’s passing (about a month after I met him) broke 
                the hearts of many including mine. Rest in piece, Ma Fil.

            <p>Musicians, artists, and craftsmen maybe mortals, but their contributions to the community, 
                to a culture, to the T’boli’s, and the Filipinos are very ingrained that it shines a 
                lifetime.Their songs will be sung, their skills will be passed, their names will be
                 remembered. The T’boli culture and traditions have outlived generations, and I’m 
                 positive it will see more.</p>
