              </div>
              <p>When you talk to others… speak positively about us (Filipinos) and our country (Philippines)” from Alexander H. Lacson’s book, ’12 Little Things Every Filipino Can Do To Help Our Country’.</p>
              <p>Filipinos are bound by an oath as sacred as Mother Nature – to love the country, to serve the country – and being an ordinary citizen as I am is no excuse not to fulfill my sacramental obligation. Thus, finding a way to contribute for the betterment or in honor of the Philippines and the Filipino people has become a personal pursuit of purpose.</p>
                <p>Blame traveling for inflaming these ideals for in these journeys I found the fuel. No less than the Philippine Islands itself from summit to sea and everything in between are the embers that kept my fire burning. Ideals forged by traveling. Witnessing breath-taking landscapes and tropical beaches that have the makings of a paradise. An island nation molded by peoples of diverse cultures, religion, and beliefs yet stand together as one identity. Sixty seven thousand years of rich history that shaped the Philippines to an extraordinary country that it is today. The farther I went, the more I see and learn, the more this profound attachment grows.</p>
                <p>Such great inspirations compelled me to create BLakwatsero.com with a rock-solid motive: to bring the Philippines to the Filipinos. This travel blog holds an eccentric collection of narratives that takes readers on a journey across local destinations both within reach and those far-flung. Here you’ll find tales of adventures – places, people, and life – told in form of images. It is a smorgasbord of visual delight that makes reading Lakwatsero.com a one-of-a-kind experience in its own right.</p>
                <p>Beauty and positivity, through words and images, are the instruments of Lakwatsero.com in spurring this new-aged revolution. Means that are simple yet powerful enough to start a ripple of optimism, goodness, and hope. With these humble tools I hope to touch the lives of many and perhaps rekindle a light of patriotism that has long been sitting dormant in the darkest crevasses of our hearts.</p>
